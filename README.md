Brain tumour is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in the brain. Brain tumours can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).
One of the tests to diagnose brain tumour is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
In the field of Medical Image Analysis, research on Brain tumors is one of the most prominent ones.
Tumor segmentation is one of the most difficult task in medical image.

The method uses morphological filtering as pre-processing technique which enhance the images in the dataset.
The proposed method provides a simple yet effective way of detecting brain tumours that can aid physicians in making accurate diagnoses and treatment plans.
